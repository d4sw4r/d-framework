# D-Fraamework

## intruduction
D-Framework is a minimal MVC framework with full dependency injection.

I wrote this framework for education purposes back in 2016 when I started my career as a PHP developer. Hopefully its useful to someone who wants to build an own framework or get an idea of where to start. There is no more active development!

## how to use
1. clone
2. composer install
3. use web/index.php as entrypoint for your webserver
